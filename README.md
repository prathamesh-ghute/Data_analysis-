One important aspect of this dataset is the pricing information. The recorded prices represent the official launch prices of the mobile phones at the time they were first introduced in the market. Prices vary based on the country and the launch period, meaning older models reflect their original launch prices, while newer models include their most recent launch prices. This makes the dataset valuable for studying price trends over time and comparing smartphone affordability across different regions.
